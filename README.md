# About Me

Hi Reader,&#x20;

I'm Subhash and I work as a Security Engineer \[Blue Team] at Microsoft. When I'm not working, I generally get my hands dirty and document my experiences and learnings here. All for a safer internet.

I used to be a Red Teamer back in the day and old habits die hard. I'm passionate about securing organizations (through offensive and defensive security research), security tooling/automation.&#x20;

I'm still learning (like many others in the industry) and would love to take any constructive criticism or feedback you may have for me. Please reach out using [these ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/pbssubhash)details. I'd love to have a chat, learn, grow and contribute back to the community.

> _<mark style="color:blue;">**I believe that to fight the resourceful adversaries, the entire security community must come together and share the intel/learning.**</mark>_&#x20;

Here are some quick links for you to explore my work:
