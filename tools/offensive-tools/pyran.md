## FAQ

### Q. How do I run/execute it on my Windows machine?

A. Download the latest release: [Py-Ran Releases](https://github.com/pbssubhash/Py-Ran/releases/download/0.1/Py-Ran\_Release\_v0.1.zip); PASSWORD for the ZIP is `pyran`

### Q. My AV/EDR did not detect the execution. What should I do?

A. It means your environment is not ready to stop the tiny-est (not sure if that's a word, lol) ransomware threats. You have a lot of work to do. (First setup a backup mechanism!)

### Q. My AV/EDR detected the execution. Does it mean I'm safe?

A. Not really. Py-Ran is a very simple ransomware simulator. Watch this space for more details on possible precautions and steps against ransomwares.

## TO-DO

* &#x20;Add some randomness and Configuration wizard.
* &#x20;Beat EDRs at their own game!
* &#x20;Write some references about precautions to be taken to avoid ransomware attacks
